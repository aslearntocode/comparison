          At Financial Health, we're always looking for products that simplify personal finance for usersâ€”and Kiwi's RuPay credit card is a strong step in that direction. By combining UPI convenience with the power of credit, Kiwi has addressed some of the most common pain points consumers face with traditional credit cards.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-6 text-indigo-800">What Makes Kiwi Different?</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-6 text-gray-800">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Instant Digital Onboarding</span>
            <p className="mt-1 text-gray-700">Kiwi allows users to apply for a credit card digitally through their app. With video KYC and Aadhaar-based verification, most users can get access to a virtual credit card in minutesâ€”no physical documents or card delivery delays required.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Works on UPI</span>
            <p className="mt-1 text-gray-700">Once issued, the card can be linked to Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or used directly via Kiwi's own app. This means users can "Scan & Pay" with UPI, but the money is charged to their credit card instead of a bank accountâ€”making it one of the first seamless ways to use credit on UPI.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Lifetime-Free and Transparent</span>
            <p className="mt-1 text-gray-700">There are no joining or annual fees, and users enjoy an interest-free period of up to 50 days. This transparency makes it easier for users to manage repayments without hidden surprises.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Cashback and Rewards</span>
            <p className="mt-1 text-gray-700">Users earn cashback on eligible UPI transactions. For example, Kiwi offers 1% cashback on QR-code spends. There are even paid plans like Kiwi Neon that offer higher cashback and benefits such as lounge access.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Full App Control</span>
            <p className="mt-1 text-gray-700">The Kiwi app provides spend tracking, instant card block/unblock features, credit limit management, and transaction alertsâ€”putting users in full control of their credit.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Should You Apply?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          If you're looking for an easier way to start using creditâ€”and want the flexibility of UPI paymentsâ€”Kiwi is a smart, digital-first option.
