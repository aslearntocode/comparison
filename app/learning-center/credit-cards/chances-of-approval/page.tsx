                Many people believe that having a good credit score is enough to get approved for any credit card they apply for. But in reality, lenders go far beyond your score when assessing your creditworthiness. Your credit score is only one part of a larger risk model that banks and NBFCs use to decide whether to approve or reject your application.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  A credit score (like a CIBIL score or Experian score) is a summary of your credit behavior‚Äîbut it's not the full picture. Banks want to know not just how you've behaved in the past, but how risky you are today and whether you fit their internal criteria.

                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">1. Do You Already Have a Credit Card with a Reputed Institution?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">Banks prefer applicants who have already been trusted by established lenders. For example, if you already hold a credit card from HDFC or SBI, you're seen as lower risk than someone with a card from a small NBFC or a fintech startup.</p>
                </div>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">Even one past default or late payment can be a red flag, even if your score has recovered. Lenders look at your detailed credit report, not just the score summary.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">If you have an existing relationship with the lender and are behind on any EMI, credit card bill, or loan, your application will most likely be rejected‚Äîeven with a 750+ credit score.</p>
